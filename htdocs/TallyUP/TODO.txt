NEXT:
- work on inventory
	-right click (or direct click) to edit/add notes to items
	-instead of delete button, make a "mark sold" button?
	-put delete button into EDIT button
	-stylize insert form
	-insert into personal inventory
	-create product entry, then create inventory entry simutaneaously
	-add style to tables

- mimic design on expenses

- creating update triggers (when item is sold update listing to "sold)??

- FOR 'INVOICES' :: Just create a template very similar to paypal's template system.
- login page

- table data sorting



FUTURE:
- multiple inventory sheet instances
- different company types : retailer, reseller, etc.
- settings page
