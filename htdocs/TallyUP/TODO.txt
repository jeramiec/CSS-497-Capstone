NEXT:
- work on inventory
	-insert.php ;; figure out what user should insert
	-update.php ;; get it working
	-figure out how items are inserted into expense sheet
	-instead of delete button, make a "mark sold" button?
		-put delete button into EDIT button
	-stylize insert and edit form
	-add CSS style to tables
	-translate into personal table

- mimic design on expenses

- creating update triggers (when item is sold update listing to "sold)??

- FOR 'INVOICES' :: Just create a template very similar to paypal's template system.
- login page

- table data sorting

- homepage graphics/graphs

- create logout button


FUTURE:
- multiple inventory sheet instances
- different company types : retailer, reseller, etc.
